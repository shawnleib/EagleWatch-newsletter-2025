        <p>We‚Äôve wrapped up another productive monitoring season with over <strong>24,000 nest observations submitted</strong> and countless hours of dedication from volunteers like you!</p>

	<p>We have several late nest attempts that still have young yet to fledge. Thank you for continuing to monitor these late nests until all chicks have fledged if you have a late nest.</p> 

	<p>If you stopped visiting an inactive or failed nest prior to April 1st, please go by one more time this month and submit that report to document if the status changed. You may be surprised to find an active, late nest attempt!</p>

        <div class="section-title">‚úÖ Action Items</div>
	<p>We are in the middle of verifying and cleaning up the data, which is a lengthy process. Your prompt attention to our emails requesting clarifications on your nest data is greatly appreciated. This will help us finalize the data for the season to share with state and federal agencies to document the status of the population. Once the summary is complete, I'll be in touch with dates for our End-of-Season Celebrations!</p>                
	<p>Help close the season strong by checking off these important tasks:</p>
	<p>1. If you are behind on submitting your reports, please click below to enter them now, or plan to submit them by <strong>June 1.</strong>.
	</p>2. Submit a "Season Summary" report for each nest you've monitored to give a concise review of the final nest status and outcomes. Use the Notes section to identify it with "Final Season Summary" and include any important details there as well (mate change, first clutch failed, disturbance issues, etc).</p>

	<p>3. Review your reports in this new editable table! Please click below to check your reports to ensure that the nest ID's shown are correct for the nests you visited, that the susbrate type is correct, and confirm that all eaglets you reported as seen have a final outcome of fledged or perished. Conversely, any eaglet reported as fledged or perished, must have previously been reported as seen. The table is editable so you may make changes as needed.</p>

  Review Nest Reports
</a>	
	<p> This new feature has a second map page to verify nest locations. Click below to check that the location for each nest you monitored is accurate on our map. For territories with more than one nest, the active location should be labeled with the straight ID, BO003 for example. Alternate nests will have a letter after the ID, such as BO003a amd BO003b.</p>

	<!-- Telemetry Study Launched -->

	<div class="section-title">ü¶Ö Telemetry Study Launched!</div>
      	<p>This spring we fulfilled a long-held dream of mine to launch a new telemetry tracking study with Florida's Bald Eagles! The previous telemetry studies were done 15-20 years ago and Florida's landscape has changed dramatically during that time--more people, more roads, and the conversion of natural areas to developed. How may those earlier findings have changed over time as our eagles learn to adapt to increasing urbanization? This knowledge will help us stay on the forefront of understanding population parameters and pressures in order to better inform conservation management decisions to ensure a bright future for Florida's Bald Eagles.</p> 
	</p>Read more about this study <a href="https://www.audubon.org/florida/news/telemetry-tracking-bald-eagles-real-time" target="_blank">here</a>

	</p>Many thanks to our sponsors for the tags for the 2025 season: Kathleen & Jim Moreo, Annie Bouchard and Kevin Bohne, John Corbitt and Kathy Sayre and Sylvia Hatcher.

	<p>We have been so fortunate to have Cheryl Merz with us as the EagleWatch Assistant these past 6 months. Words seem insufficient to describe the positive impact she has made on the program. Her help has been invaluable! Cheryl's seasonal role ends June 14th, after which her email address (cheryl.merz@audubon.org) will no longer be active, so be sure to redirect emails to eaglewatch@audubon.org. Please join me in thanking her for all she's done. </p>
        <p>Cheryl and I are incredibly grateful for your time, dedication, and passion. Your commitment to protecting Bald Eagles makes a real difference, and we couldn‚Äôt do this without you.</p>
        <p><em>Until next season, soar high and stay inspired!  -Shawnlei Breeding, EagleWatch Program Manager</em></p>
